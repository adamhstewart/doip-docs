# Gameplay Rules
1. **Posting Style:** Format your posts clearly - Use normal text for actions. and bold  text in quotation for dialogue. Example: Nyrah quietly steps forward. **“What do you see, Loronak?”**
2. **Dice Rolling:** Use the Avrae bot for rolling dice and post rolls and results in the #dice-rolls channel. Dice rolling is not a substitute for RP - use the #ic-chat to clarify your actions and then the results of the dice roll.
3. **Combat Pacing:** During combat, players must take their turn within 24 hours to keep things moving, after which the DM will assign a simple action to them. Use initiative order as directed by the Avrae bot (see more on Avrae below).
4. **Character Development:** Engage in roleplay! Express your character’s thoughts, goals, and emotions to make the story rich and dynamic.
5. **God-Modding:** Do NOT control other players’ characters without permission.
