<h1 id="downtime">Downtime</h1>
<p>During periods where characters are leveling up, and perhaps at other times between adventures, there will be defined periods of downtime for characters to engage in professions, hobbies, and other activities that may be of interest or value.</p>
<h2 id="downtime-rules">Downtime Rules</h2>
<h3 id="lifestyle">Lifestyle</h3>
<p>Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle, as described in chapter 5.</p>
<p>Living a particular lifestyle doesn't have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.</p>

<h3 id="spending-downtime-days">Spending Downtime Days</h3>
<p>Spending downtime days can be done at specified times in the campaign (usually between levels) and are alloted by the DM usually in a number of tendays (the week unit in The Forgotten Realms world is ten days). Characters can split time between activities, or spend their time doing nothing or recuperating, but downtime days cannot be "banked."</p>
<p>Characters can do downtime activities by themselves, or in partnership with other characters. They can also do contract work (or commission contract work) for other characters or NPCs.</p>
<h3 id="conveying-downtime-activities">Conveying Downtime Activities</h3>
<p>Downtime activities don't happen, and their material gains aren't realized, until they are conveyed in in <code>#ic-chat</code> channel. This can take place in several ways (not an exhaustive list):
- Through real-time role play while the downtime (or part of the downtime) is happening. This could be particularly effective when characters are doing downtime together.
- Through a story when the character returns to the group - at the pub, on the trail, etc.
- By some sort of correspondence - a message or letter sent by the character to the group.</p>
<h2 id="downtime-activities">Downtime Activities</h2>
<p>This list of Activities is compiled from the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#CraftingEquipment">Player's Handbook</a> (PHB), <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/treasure#CraftingMagicItems">The Dungeon Master's Guide</a> (DMG), <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/xgte/downtime-revisited#Chapter2DowntimeRevisited">Xanathar's Guide to Everything</a> (XGtE), and <a href="https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LX_OTKbS5mc-IZmaOF0">Colville West Marches Downtime Documentation</a> (CWM).

<h3 id="buyingselling-a-magic-item">Buying/Selling a Magic Item</h3>
<h4 id="buying-a-magic-item">Buying a Magic Item</h4>
<p>Purchasing a magic item requires time and money to seek out and contact people willing to sell items. Even then, there is no guarantee a seller will have the items a character desires.</p>
<p><strong>Resources.</strong> Finding magic items to purchase requires at least 5 days of effort and 100 gp in expenses. Spending more time and money increases your chance of finding a high-quality item.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution.</strong> A character seeking to buy a magic item makes a Charisma (Persuasion) check to determine the quality of the seller found. The character gains a +1 bonus on the check for every 5 days beyond the first that is spent seeking a seller and a +1 bonus for every additional 100 gp spent on the search, up to a maximum bonus of +10.</p>
<p>The total of the check dictates which table (in the DMG) the DM will roll on to determine which items are on the market. The price will be determined by a DM roll on the following table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Rarity</th>
<th>Asking Price*</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Common</td>
<td>(1d6 + 1) × 10 gp</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Uncommon</td>
<td>1d6 × 100 gp</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rare</td>
<td>2d10 × 1,000 gp</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Very rare</td>
<td>(1d4 + 1) × 10,000 gp</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Legendary</td>
<td>2d6 × 25,000 gp</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If you are seeking a particular item, tell the DM in advance of your persuasion roll, and it will appear on the list of items for sale when satisfying the following check:</p>
<table>

<h4 id="selling-a-magic-item">Selling a Magic Item</h4>
<p>Selling a magic item is by no means an easy task. Con artists and thieves are always looking out for an easy score, and there’s no guarantee that a character will receive a good offer even if a legitimate buyer is found.</p>
<p><strong>Resources.</strong> A character can find a buyer for one magic item by spending 5 days and 25 gp, which is used to spread word of the desired sale. A character must pick one item at a time to sell.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution.</strong> A character who wants to sell an item must make a Charisma (Persuasion) check to determine what kind of offer comes in. The character can always opt not to sell, instead forfeiting the workweek of effort and trying again later. Use the Magic Item Base Prices and Magic Item Offer tables to determine the sale price.</p>

<h3 id="carousing">Carousing</h3>
<p>Drunken debauchery and merriment among adventurers is anything but rare, as life is hard and celebrations make it all better. It could be that you just saw a fellow adventurer get brutally mauled and nothing of their corpse remains, you could have found the lost city of Don Juan and are rich beyond your wildest dreams, or maybe you just wanna see what happens, regardless you’re drinking, and doing so in copious amounts.</p>
<p><strong>Resources:</strong> 30 gp and 3 days of downtime</p>
<p><strong>Resolution:</strong> Roll a d100 and add your Persuasion Bonus and compare the total to Carousing table using the resolution result column to determine the result.</p>
<p>You may incur additional gp and downtime day costs based on your roll.</p>
<p>Any additional costs must be paid off before you are able to perform any other downtime activities.</p>
<p><strong>Prequest Action:</strong> For 10 gp and a single downtime day, your character could spend the day before a quest carousing if the DM allows it. This may place them in an interesting position to be found at the beginning of the quest. You may collect the normal Resolution results and your character will be located in the location specified in the last column of the table.</p>
<p>Regardless of the outcome, make a DC 10 Constitution check. On a failure your character is pretty hungover for the next 24 hours. Additional checks may be required to avoid accidents.</p>

<h3 id="crafting">Crafting</h3>
<p>A character who has the time, the money, and the needed tools can use downtime to craft armor, weapons, clothing, or other kinds of non-magical items.</p>
<h4 id="crafting-non-magical-items">Crafting Non-Magical Items</h4>
<p><strong>Resources:</strong> In addition to the appropriate tools for the item to be crafted, a character needs raw materials worth half of the item’s selling cost and a number of downtime days equal to its gold cost divided by: your tool modifier or 5, whichever is larger.  Multiple characters can combine their efforts. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Use your judgment when determining how many characters can collaborate on an item.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution:</strong> With the proper tools and gold, the character successfully crafts the non-magical and can add it to their inventory, gift it to another player, or sell it for the full listed cost.</p>
<h4 id="brewing-potions-of-healing">Brewing Potions of Healing</h4>
<p>Potions of healing fall into a special category for item crafting, separate from other magic items. A character who has proficiency with the herbalism kit can create these potions. The times and costs for doing so are summarized on the Potion of Healing Creation table.</p>

<p><strong>Assistants.</strong> Characters can combine their efforts to shorten the crafting time. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Normally, only one other character can assist you, but the DM might allow more assistants.</p>
<p><strong>Raw Materials.</strong> The cost in the table above represents the raw materials needed to make a magic item. Rather than pay the full amount shown in the table the player may ask the DM for a quest to defeat a monster for half of the cost of the raw materials.

<p>If a magic item incorporates an item that has a purchase cost (such as a weapon or a suit of armor), you must also pay that entire cost or craft that item using the rules in the Player’s Handbook. For example, to make +1 Armor (Plate Armor), you must pay 3,500 GP or craft the armor.</p>
<p><strong>Spells.</strong> If a magic item allows its user to cast any spells from it, you must have all those spells prepared every day you spend crafting the item.                                                   |</p>

<p>To attempt the crime, the character makes three checks: Dexterity (Stealth); Charisma (Deception); and the higher of Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception). The player can also choose to replace the lowest of these skill checks with a tool check using either thieves’ tools (for robberies), disguise kit (for impersonations), or forgery kit (for forgeries) <strong>only</strong> if they have proficiency.</p>
<p>If none of the checks are successful (0 of 3), the character is caught and jailed. The character must spend a number of downtime days in jail equal to the DC and pay a fine equal to the target value. At the player’s discretion, such a failure could involve additional forms of restitution or penance.</p>
<p>If only one check is successful (1 of 3), the heist fails, but the character escapes.
If two checks are successful (2 of 3), the heist is a partial success, netting the character half the payout.
If all three checks are successful (3 of 3), the character earns the full value listed.</p>
<p><strong>Complications:</strong>
Complications. A life of crime is filled with complications. Roll on the Crime Complications table (or create a complication of your own) if the character succeeds on only one check.

<p><strong>Complications:</strong> Gambling tends to attract unsavory individuals.

<h3 id="relaxationrecuperation">Relaxation/Recuperation</h3>
<p>Sometimes the best thing to do between adventures is relax. Whether a character wants a hard-earned vacation or needs to recover from injuries, relaxation is the ideal option for adventurers who need a break. This option is also ideal for players who don’t want to make use of the downtime system.</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong> Relaxation requires 5 days. A character needs to maintain at least a modest lifestyle while relaxing to gain the benefit of the activity.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution.</strong> Characters who maintain at least a modest lifestyle while relaxing gain several benefits. While relaxing, a character gains advantage on saving throws to recover from long-acting diseases and poisons. In addition, at the end of the week, a character can end one effect that keeps the character from regaining hit points, or can restore one ability score that has been reduced to less than its normal value. This benefit cannot be used if the harmful effect was caused by a spell or some other magical effect with an ongoing duration.</p>
<p>If the character has no conditions that need recover the benefits of any 5-day period of relaxation are a pool of temporary hit points equal to twice the level of the character. Each pool of hit points must be used together and another pool cannot be used until after a long rest. Any held pools expire at the completion of that level.</p>

<h3 id="religious-servicedevotion">Religious Service/Devotion</h3>
<p>Characters with a religious bent might want to spend downtime in service to a temple, either by attending rites or by proselytizing in the community. Someone who undertakes this activity has a chance of winning the favor of the temple’s leaders.</p>
<p><strong>Resources:</strong> Performing religious service requires access to, and often attendance at, a temple whose beliefs and ethos align with the character’s. If such a place is available, the activity takes 5 days but involves no gold piece expenditure.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution:</strong> At the end of the required time, the character chooses to make either an Intelligence (Religion) check or a Charisma (Persuasion) check. The total of the check determines the benefits of service, as shown on the table below.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;">Check Total</th>
<th>Result</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">1–8</td>

<td>You earn one favor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">18+</td>
<td>You earn two favors.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>A favor, in broad terms, is a promise of future assistance from a representative of the temple. It can be expended to ask the temple for help in dealing with a specific problem, for general political or social support, or to reduce the cost of cleric spellcasting by 50 percent. A favor could also take the form of a deity’s intervention, such as an omen, a vision, or a minor miracle provided at a key moment. This latter sort of favor is expended by the DM, who also determines its nature.</p>
<p>Favors earned need not be expended immediately, but only a certain number can be stored up. A character can have a maximum number of unused favors equal to 1 + the character’s Charisma modifier (minimum of one unused favor).</p>
<p><strong>Complications:</strong> Temples can be labyrinths of political and social scheming. Even the best-intentioned sect can fall prone to rivalries. A character who serves a temple risks becoming embroiled in such struggles. Every 5 days spent in religious service brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Religious Service Complications table.</p>

<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
<p>The world contains many secrets waiting to be discovered and understood. Such things are generally only truly able to be understood with field research or with more experience, yet it is never unwise to go to a library and seek past knowledge to aid in your current endeavors, or simply run tests in a safer, and academic environment.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Approval from the DM before the quest is run or approval from a DM involved with the subject you wish to research.</p>
<p><strong>Resources:</strong> A character needs access to a well stocked library to conduct research. Assuming such access is available, conducting research requires one downtime day and at least 50 gp spent on materials, library costs, and other expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution:</strong> The character declares the focus of the research: a specific creature, person, place, or thing. After five downtime days, the character rolls Intelligence (Investigation). Additionally the character gains a +1 bonus per 50 gp spent beyond the initial 50 gp, to a maximum of +6, representing the hiring of additional assistants to aid in research.</p>
<p>After rolling, consult the table below for the results of your research and if you gain any follow-up questions. The DM may allow tangential questions if they pop up (for instance if your research reveals a location after the first question you may ask your second question about the location, etc.) but may curate the questions how they wish.</p>

<h3 id="training">Training</h3>
<p>Downtime can be spent putting in the time to learn a new language, trade, or skill that you are partial to or think you'll need later. You may even fine tune your skills to an even more skilled state.</p>
<p><strong>Resources:</strong> Learning a skill, language, or tool proficiency costs a base of 30 days of downtime and 10 gp per day. The time and cost is reduced 5 days times the characters Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p>Learning a standard language, an instrument, or gaming set costs half the downtime and gold. As a standard language, you can also learn a sign language for a language you know.</p>
<p>To gain expertise, you cannot have gained expertise through this activity before and must spend 40 days of downtime, and 20 gp per day. The time and cost is reduced 5 days times the characters Intelligence modifier. This is separate from any potential costs related to gaining proficiency in the skill.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution:</strong> If learning a skill, select a skill from the starting skills of a class you have 3 or more levels in that you are not already proficient in. If learning a tool or language you are free to choose any.</p>
<p>You become proficient in the skill, language, or tool that you chose.</p>
<p>Expertise may be gained in any skill, or tool with which you are already proficient regardless of class.</p>

<h3 id="worktrade">Work/Trade</h3>
<p>When all else fails, an adventurer can turn to an honest trade to earn a living. This activity represents a character’s attempt to find temporary work, the quality and wages of which are difficult to predict.</p>
<p><strong>Resources.</strong> Performing a job requires 5 days of effort.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution.</strong> To determine how much money a character earns, the character makes an ability check and consult the Wages table to see how much money is generated according to the total of the check.</p>
