# Downtime

During periods where characters are leveling up, and perhaps at other times during adventures, there will be defined periods of downtime for characters to engage in professions, hobbies, and other activities that may be of interest or value.

## Downtime Activities
This list of Activities is compiled from the [Player's Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#CraftingEquipment) (PHB), [The Dungeon Master's Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/treasure#CraftingMagicItems) (DMG), [Xanathar's Guide to Everything](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/xgte/downtime-revisited#Chapter2DowntimeRevisited) (XGtE), and [Colville West Marches Downtime Documentation](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LX_OTKbS5mc-IZmaOF0) (CWM). It's not exhaustive of all of the activities that a player could engage in - if you have another idea, contact the DM.

### Buying/Selling a Magic Item
TBD

### Carousing
TBD

### Crafting
A character who has the time, the money, and the needed tools can use downtime to craft armor, weapons, clothing, or other kinds of non-magical items.

**Resources:** In addition to the appropriate tools for the item to be crafted, a character needs raw materials worth half of the item’s selling cost and a number of downtime days equal to its gold cost divided by: your tool modifier or 5, whichever is larger.  Multiple characters can combine their efforts. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Use your judgment when determining how many characters can collaborate on an item.

**Resolution:** With the proper tools and gold, the character successfully crafts the non-magical and can add it to their inventory, gift it to another player, or sell it for the full listed cost.

### Crime
Sometimes it pays to be bad. This activity gives a character the chance to make some extra cash, at the risk of arrest.

**Resources:** A character must spend 5 downtime days and an amount of gp depending on the target mark.

**Resolution:** First choose a desired mark. The mark chosen affects the DC and reward.

| DC | Cost | Value |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 10 | 15 gp | 150 gp - robbery of a struggling merchant |
| 15 | 25 gp | 250 gp - robbery of a prosperous merchant |
| 20 | 50 gp | 500 gp - robbery of a noble |
| 25 | 100 gp | 1,000 gp - robbery of one of the riches figures in town |

To attempt the crime, the character makes three checks: Dexterity (Stealth); Charisma (Deception); and the player’s choice of Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception). The player can also choose to replace one of these skill checks with a tool check using either thieves’ tools, disguise kit, or forgery kit.

If none of the checks are successful (0 of 3), the character is caught and jailed. The character must spend a number of downtime days in jail equal to the DC and pay a fine equal to the target value. At the player’s discretion, such a failure could involve additional forms of restitution or penance.

If only one check is successful (1 of 3), the heist fails, but the character escapes.
If two checks are successful (2 of 3), the heist is a partial success, netting the character half the payout.
If all three checks are successful (3 of 3), the character earns the full value listed.

**Complications:**
Complications. A life of crime is filled with complications. Roll on the Crime Complications table (or create a complication of your own) if the character succeeds on only one check. If the character’s rival is involved in crime or law enforcement, a complication ensues if the character succeeds on only two checks.

| d8 | Complication                                                                                     |
|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1 | A bounty equal to your earnings is offered for information about your crime.*                    |
|  2 | An unknown person contacts you, threatening to reveal your crime if you don’t render a service.* |
|  3 | Your victim is financially ruined by your crime.                                                 |
|  4 | Someone who knows of your crime has been arrested on an unrelated matter.*                       |
|  5 | Your loot is a single, easily identified item that you can’t fence in this region.               |
|  6 | You robbed someone who was under a local crime lord’s protection, and who now wants revenge.     |
|  7 | Your victim calls in a favor from a guard, doubling the efforts to solve the case.               |
|  8 | Your victim asks one of your adventuring companions to solve the crime.                          |

### Gambling
**Resources:** This activity requires one day of effort plus a stake of at least 20 gp, to a maximum of 1,000 gp or more, as you see fit. Characters cannot earn more than a total of 10,000 gp from this activity

**Resolution:** The character must make a series of checks, with a DC determined at random based on the quality of the competition that the character runs into. Part of the risk of gambling is that one never knows who might end up sitting across the table.

The character makes three checks: Wisdom (Insight), Charisma (Deception), and Charisma (Intimidation). If the character has proficiency with an appropriate gaming set, that tool proficiency can replace the relevant skill in any of the checks. The DC for each of the checks is 5 + 2d10; generate a separate DC for each one.

Consult the Gambling Results table to see how the character did.

| Gambling Result |	Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| 0 successes	| Lose all the money you bet, and accrue a debt equal to that amount. |
| 1 success	| Lose half the money you bet. |
| 2 successes |	Gain the amount you bet plus half again more. |
| 3 successes |	Gain double the amount you bet. |

**Complications:** Gambling tends to attract unsavory individuals. The potential complications involved come from run-ins with the law and associations with various criminals tied to the activity. Every day spent gambling brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Gambling Complications table.

### Research

### Scribing a Scroll

### Training
Downtime can be spent putting in the time to learn a new language, trade, or skill that you are partial to or think you'll need later. You may even fine tune your skills to an even more skilled state.

**Resources:** Learning a skill, language, or tool proficiency costs a base of 30 days of downtime and 10 gp per day. The time and cost is reduced 5 days times the characters Intelligence modifier.

Learning a standard language, an instrument, or gaming set costs half the downtime and gold. As a standard language, you can also learn a sign language for a language you know.

To gain expertise, you cannot have gained expertise through this activity before and must spend 40 days of downtime, and 20 gp per day. The time and cost is reduced 5 days times the characters Intelligence modifier. This is separate from any potential costs related to gaining proficiency in the skill.


**Resolution:** If learning a skill, select a skill from the starting skills of a class you have 3 or more levels in that you are not already proficient in. If learning a tool or language you are free to choose any.

You become proficient in the skill, language, or tool that you chose.

Expertise may be gained in any skill, or tool with which you are already proficient regardless of class.
