# Hunting & Foraging

Hunting and Foraging can be done during travel and are dependent on the landscape in which you are travelling, Generally hunting and foraging can be performed twice a day during travel and extend your travel time by 1 hour each time it is performed (by any member of the party). The DM will give specific instruction if hunting or foraging can't occur or if there are different time allotmwents in a particular scenario.

## Hunting
Hunting uses the `!hunting` Avrae command, and it should be executed in the `#dice-rolls` channel. The activity involves three steps: finding an animal or animals, killing it, and harvesting the meat. Each landscape has a different table of animals and different checks to be successful - survival for finding, weapon proficiency for killing, and survival again for harvesting. All three steps and the associated checks are run automatically by the Avrae bot.

**Example:** Mal wants to go hunting on the Triboar Trail. Most of the trail is considered `grasslands`. He would execute the following command

```sh
!hunting grasslands
```

The result of the roll will tell you if an animal was found, if you killed it, and how much meat you harvested. Any harvested meat must be added to your inventory and counts toward your encumberance.

The following landscapes are available for hunting:

- Grasslands
- Mountains
- Forest
- Coastal

The DM will inform players which region they are in when hunting can occur.

## Foraging

Foraging is the act of finding and harvesting food items from the environment - items can come in the form of nuts, berries, herbs, barks, etc. Each landscape has it's own particular materials, and DC checks to find and harvest them.

**Example:** Oak wants to go foraging in the Neverwinter Woods. The Woods is considered `forest`. He would execute the following command

```sh
!foraging forest
```

The DM will inform players which region they are in when foraging can occur.

The following landscapes are available for foraging:

- Grasslands
- Mountains
- Forest
- Coastal

## Additional Rules
- Foraging and hunting both "use" the allotted time during travel, so if there are two alloted times, a player can hunt once and forage once, forage twice, or hunt twice.
- Rules on expiration of items is TBD.
