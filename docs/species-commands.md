# Species Specific Commands

## Aasimar
### Celestial Revelations
There aren't good aliases for this trait, but the attributes can be applied manually. In order to deal 2 extra damage (Necrotic for Necrotic Shroud or Radiant for Heavenly Wings and Inner Radiance), you can add extra damage to the attack roll like this:

```sh
!cast "Dissonant Whispers" -d 2[radiance]
```
This will add 2 extra HP of radiance damage on any hit.

### Healing Hands
To use healing hands:
```sh
!a "Healing Hands" -t "Mal Elkhorn"
```
This would add the appropriate number of HP to Mal.
