# Combat Mechanics
These are house rules for this guild based that are either different then 2024 5e rules as written or are further clarifications of existing rules.

## Diagonal Movement
All character movement follows the "5-10-5" rules (5ft for the first square, then 10ft for the next square, then 5ft, then 10ft and so on).

The `!distance` alias can give an accurate assessment of the distance between spaces on a map and can be used to plan movement.

```sh
!distance a1 b13
```

## Administering Healing Potions
Healing potions can be administered as a bonus action to yourself or another character within your reach (generally 5ft).

Healing potions can be administered in any state of consciousness.

## Help Action
In order to provide help, you must have an proficiency in the skill with which with you are helping. If there is no particular skill, it is a DM discretion.

The help action as a distraction for advantage on attacks can be performed by any character within 5ft of the target. This serves as the "flanking" rule in that advantage can only be granted when an action is used to give it, not simply by virtue of being within 5ft of the target. The most common use of this action is by familiars/summoned.

## Surprise Attacks
In cases where surprise is established - generally through hidden/invisible condition for the party - the attacking party gets a full round of turns in initiative order. This surprise round counts as a full round for durations of effects, spells, etc. After each character has taken their turn, combat proceeds at the top of the initiative order.

Full party invisibility/hidden condition can be achieved as a group when over half of the party succeeds on a stealth check or the DM otherwise determines they are hidden or invisible.

## Firearms
No firearms.
