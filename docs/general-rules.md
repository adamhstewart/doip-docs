# General Rules
1. **Be Respectful:** Treat everyone with respect and kindness. Harassment, hate speech, or discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated.

2. **Stay In-Character (IC) & Out-of-Character (OOC):** Use designated channels for in-character (gameplay) and out-of-character (chatter) discussions. Use parentheses or spoiler tags for brief OOC comments in IC channels: (OOC: Example message) or ||OOC: Example||.

3. **Follow the DM's Lead:** The Dungeon Master’s rulings are final. Any disputes can be discussed politely in private or an OOC channel.

4. **No Meta-Gaming:** Don’t use player knowledge to influence your character’s actions. Keep the game immersive and fun for everyone.

5. **Respect Server Pacing:** Respond within 24 hours to posts in game play channels. If you need to slow down, let the group or DM know. If you’re inactive for more than a week without notice, your character may be NPC’d or removed.

6. **No Spamming or Off-Topic Posts:** Keep discussions in the appropriate channels. Limit memes and unrelated chatter to the "ooc-chat" or designated channels.

7. **Keep it Clean and Safe:** No NSFW content or inappropriate behavior. Keep cursing and mature topics to a reasonable minimum.
