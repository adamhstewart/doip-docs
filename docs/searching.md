# Searching and Investigating

The house rules for searching and investigating are designed to make it easier for multiple players, on their own initiative, to search and investigate without having to wait for other players or the DM.

## Searching a Room
To initiate a search, it's always a perception check - but you have two options:


1. Search the whole room - this can only be done once by each player.
<br>`Search the Banshee's bedroom [[c:perc]]`

2. Search a specific element in the room (e.g. search the fireplace) - this can be done once per element by each player and has a slight bonus to the DC for it's specificity.
<br>`Search under the Banshee's bed [[c:perc]]`

## Investigating
For figuring out how something works (is it trapped, does the statue move, etc) - this is always for something specific - it's investigation. Note: finding traps and how they work is always investigation, disarming them is a dexterity check (generally with thief's tools)
<br>`Check the door for traps [[c:inv]]`

## Formatting your Roll
Also, it's much easier if you roll the checks inline like so:
- `Investigating the statue [[check:investigation]]` or
- `searching the entire room [[c:perc]]`

This way the DM doesn't need to guess which one it applies to or move back and forth between channels.
